<p>This document provides the mathematical details and code for the analysis <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/deconfusiondevice/p/forecasting-accidentally-caused-pandemics?r=11048&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">“Forecasting accidentally-caused pandemics”</a>. Source code and data <a href="https://github.com/joshuablake/lab-leak-base-rate">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>To estimate the base rate, we need two quantities. First, the number of pandemics that lab accidents have caused. This can be easily found by looking at the historic record. Second, a measure of the amount of lab experiments that could cause such a pandemic; I refer to this as “risky research units”. I then extrapolate research units into the future to forecast a base rate for lab accidents causing pandemics.</p>
<p>No good data exists on risky research units directly. However, by applying a continuous time <a href="https://blog.joshuablake.co.uk/p/gamma-poisson">Gamma-Poisson model</a> we only need a measure that is proportional to the number of experiments.</p>
<div id="measuring-risky-research-units" class="section level2">
<h2>Measuring risky research units</h2>
<p>I consider three proxies for the number of risky research units being conducted. First, the number of BSL-4 labs (<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/62fa334a3a6fe8320f5dcf7e/t/6412d3120ee69a4f4efbec1f/1678955285754/KCL0680_BioLabs+Report_Digital.pdf">GlobalBioLabs 2023</a>). I transform this into the net increase in labs per year to reduce autocorrelation. Second, the number of known lab accidents as reported by <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-752">Manheim and Lewis 2022</a>. Third, the number of virology papers published per year according to Web of Science (downloaded from their website). These appear to be growing at roughly the same rate, as seen by fitting either separate or joint Poisson regressions to the datasets.</p>

<h1>Forecast</h1>
<p>One lab risk pandemic has occurred to date: the 1977 Russian flu pandemic. COVID-19’s origin is debated, and I present either scenario.</p>
<p>The forecast will be based on three quantities. These can be calculated from the historic record, and the growth rate of risky research units <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> estimated above.</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of risky research units conducted up until the time used for calculating the base rate, <span class="math inline">\(t_b\)</span>. We will normalize this to 1, meaning that we define the number of units as <span class="math inline">\(u(t) = r \exp(r(t-t_b))\)</span>. This gives the total risky research units conducted up until <span class="math inline">\(t_b\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\int_{-\infty}^{t_b} u(t) dt = \exp(0) - \exp(-\infty) = 1\)</span>.</li>
<li>The number of risky research units conducted in the period we are predicting, from <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> years. This is <span class="math inline">\(u_p = \int_{t_0}^{t_0+d} u(t) dt = \exp(r(t_0+d-t_b)) - \exp(r(t_0-t_b)) = \exp(r(t_0-t_b)) (\exp(rd) - 1)\)</span>.</li>
<li>The number of lab-leak pandemics that have occurred in the period used for calculating the base rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimate for the expected number of lab-leak pandemics per risky research unit (using a Gamma(1/3, 1/3) prior) is Gamma(a+1/3, 1). The expected number of lab-leak pandemics over the period of interest is <span class="math inline">\(u_p(a + 1/3)\)</span>. The probability of there being at least one pandemic is <span class="math inline">\(1 - 1 / (1 + u_p)^(a + 1/3)\)</span>. <a href="https://blog.joshuablake.co.uk/p/gamma-poisson">See here for justification of the prior and the formulae giving these results.</a></p>

<p>For comparison, Marani et al. (2021) suggests 2.5 zoonotic pandemics per decade, although this rate may have decreased since World War II.</p>
<p>Below I show how the rate is changing over time due to the change in risky research units.</p>
